The Update Framework (TUF) helps developers maintain the security of a software 
update system, even against attackers that compromise the repository or signing keys.
TUF provides a flexible framework and specification that developers can adopt into
any software update system.

TUF is hosted by the [**Linux Foundation**](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) as
part of the [**Cloud Native Computing Foundation**](https://www.cncf.io/) (CNCF).
It's currently an **incubating** project under the CNCF and is used [in
production](/adoptions.html) by companies such as Cloudflare, Docker, DigitalOcean,
Flynn, IBM, Microsoft, LEAP, Kolide, and VMware.  A variant of TUF called
[**Uptane**](https://uptane.github.io/) is widely used to secure over-the-air 
updates in automobiles.
